# Swift Practice Codes 🍏

Welcome to the **Swift Practice Codes** repository! This project contains a collection of Swift scripts designed to demonstrate and practice core Swift programming concepts. It serves as a personal knowledge base and playground for intermediate Swift topics.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository covers various fundamental and intermediate Swift concepts, including:

- **Arrays**: Initialization, manipulation, subscripting, iteration, and bulk updates.
- **Dictionaries**: creating and managing key-value pairs.
- **Optionals**: Handling `nil` safely using `if let`, `guard`, nil-coalescing (`??`), and forced unwrapping.
- **Closures**: Syntax, capturing values, and passing closures as parameters.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functional programming patterns using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## 📂 File Structure

Here is a quick guide to the files in this repository:

| Category | File(s) | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Arrays** | `array0.swift` - `array4iteration.swift` | Basics of arrays, subscripting, manipulation, and iteration. |
| **Dictionaries** | `dict0.swift` | Basic dictionary operations. |
| **Functions** | `sfunc0reduce.swift`, `sfunc1filter.swift`, `sfunc2map.swift` | Examples of higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`). |
| **Optionals** | `optional*.swift`, `if_let_binding.swift`, `nilCoalescing.swift` | Techniques for handling optional values safely. |
| **Closures** | `ClosuresInSwift.swift` | Examples of using closures and passing them to functions. |
| **Misc** | `swiftMain.txt` | Learning log and branch planning. |

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run individual Swift files directly from the terminal.

### Prerequisites
- **macOS** with Xcode or **Swift** installed on your system.

### Running a File
Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run any file using the `swift` command:

```bash
# Navigate to the folder
cd /path/to/VsSwiftTraining

# Run a specific file (e.g., Array Manipulation)
swift array3manuplation.swift

# Run Closure examples
swift ClosuresInSwift.swift
```
